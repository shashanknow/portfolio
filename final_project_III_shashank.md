# Final Project III

## Summary

### Part I

The project began with a vague idea in my mind but one thing that was clear to me from the start was that I wanted to highlight my favorite sport Mixed Martial Arts in front of the world. I put together a few sketches which highlighted different domains of the sport like major organizations, popularity, fighting styles of champions and monetary figures. The aim was to display the grandeur of MMA to the audience. A solid call-to-action was lacking in my vision.

### Part II

In this part, I brought my earlier visualizations to life using Tableau and Flourish. I embedded these charts on to a shorthand presentation and tried to build a story around the sport of MMA. I got the opportunity to interview people with varying degree of knowledge of MMA ranging from a fan to completely agnostic. After running interviews using a script containing story and visualization related questions, I gathered lot of solid feedback. Additionally, in-class peer feedback also highlighted major gaps in my story.

### Part III

After collecting feedback from interviewees and peers, I decided to completely re-design my story and changed my perspective to that of a fighter who is inside the sport of MMA. This would help my audience get a taste of what it is like to be an MMA fighter. I removed the exceptation of interest in MMA from the audience member and made it about the journey a fighter goes through in MMA. One of the biggest things lacking in Part II was a call-to-action. I decided starting training in Mixed Martial Arts my story's call-to-action and provided information that could help them do that.

## Changes

This stage of the project involves a major re-do from the previous part where the visualizations lacked cohesiveness and the story was very scattered. Some of the biggest changes I made were:

- Got rid of various visualizations centered around MMA organisations and what is their net worth. Other charts which did not make the cut were the chart showing breakdown of champions by fighting style and UFC's PPV sales throughout the years. I learned that anyone who doesn't resonate with the sport will never pay attention to these figures.

- After keeping 1 of my 5 visualizations in part 5, I made completely new charts centered around fighters in the sport. The new charts talked about the process of finalizing a fight and the preparations that go on behind the scenes, fighter gear and other protocols involved.

- I made the storyboard theme consistent across the board following a dark theme for the most part.

- I added a call-to-action slide(finally) to help interested audience members take steps to start their own MMA journeys.

- I highlighted the part about cutting weight for a fight which is always a topic of discussion in the MMA community.

- Finally, I also highlighted benefits of training in MMA to solidify my call-to-action.

## Audience

Finally after working through all different parts of the project, I have identified my audience to be people who are not agnostic of MMA. It is required for them to like or be fans of MMA but at least know of the existence of the sport and understand the basics of it.

## Let's look at the new visualizations

### Radar Chart 

I made a radar chart of popular household names from MMA to show the different aspects of what a fighter needs to be good at and who's good at what.

### Timeline Chart

A timeline chart is a great way to show how the events leading to a fight unfold from a fighter's perspective.

 padding-bottom: 0; box-shadow: 0 2px 8px 0 rgba(63,69,81,0.16); margin-top: 1.6em; margin-bottom: 0.9em; overflow: hidden;
 border-radius: 8px; will-change: transform;">

### Line Chart

To show the gruesome process of cutting weight before a fight, I used a line chart. The chart shows how a lightweight fighter's weight changes as he strives to meet the 155 pound limit. The fighters go to extreme lengths by eating less and de-hydrating themselves in this process.

### Scrollpoint

I decided to use Shorthand's amazing scrollpoint feature by using Conor McGregor's UFC portrait. In the image are highlighted the different physical protocols a fighter experiences before fianlly entering the cage on fight night. To see this scrollpoiint, visit the shorthand link!

### Bar Chart

Lastly, I converted the Forbes 2021 Highest Paid Athletes table into a bar graph that is way more aesthetically pleasing.
