Here's where you will find all of the interesting stuff I have been working on!

## About Me
I am a Data Product Manager who loves to solve customer problems using data. I also love to find patterns and stories inside data. 

## What I hope to learn
I am thrilled to learn about the art of visual storytelling using data :)
Be it stakeholders, upper management, users or just your team, proper visualization of data is a great skill to have  to impress and educate everybody you interact with professionally or otherwise.
