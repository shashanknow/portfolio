# Final Project I

## Home of the Modern Era Gladiators: Mixed Martial Arts

## Outline

### Summary 🎁

As a combat sports fan, particularly that of Mixed Martial Arts, I want to put a spotlight on the meteoric rise of this spectacular sport. This project will showcase multiple intersting facets of MMA and showcase it's growing popularity around the world along with side-by-side comparisons with other insanely popular sports like Football. My goal is to inspire the audience to discover more about MMA and hopefully become a devoted fan!

### Lens of the audience 👁

As an audience member, I should able to get a feel for what this sport "Mixed Martial Arts" is all about and what makes it so interesting. I want to know how many people watch it and where is it the most popular. I also want to know some names or organizations to look for if I ever feel like checking it out. 
Lastly, I would like to get a sneak peek (images, gifs) and some resources (links etc) to find more information.

### The Structure 🧱

- **Introduce** the sport and talk about what it is
- **Who** are some of the big names and organizations
- **What** is the scale of events ($$$, attendance, PPV, fighter salaries)
- **When** and **where** can you watch/attend the next event

## The Narration

- I will start by talking about combat being extremely popular before sports were even invented (Gladiators in Rome).
- Next comes introduction about MMA and how it brings in the best fighters across the world onto a global stage.
- Fighters with different fighting styles and backgrounds compete to see which style is the best and who reigns supreme.
- Highlight the biggest MMA promotions like UFC and Bellator and how many people watch their events and how much money is involved.
- Further, drop names like Conor Mcgregor and Khabib Nurmagomedov and what they have done for their countries through their success in MMA.
- Visualize growing popularity with line charts containing PPV numbers and figher salaries to show there is big money in the sport compared to a sport like Football.
- Lastly, encourage audience to check out the next event and other future events.

## The Sketches

### How many fans? 🥳🍻

In order to make the audience feel like this is not some niche sport that no one really cares about, I plan on drawing a comparison by number of fans between Football, Cricket, Tennis, American Football and MMA. This is will give the audience an estimate about how relevant the sport is in a global context. To accomplish this, I use a bar graph with number of fans on the y-axis and different sports as categories on the x-axis.

### Who are the big promotions? 🗣

There were 2 things I was trying to achieve with this chart. Show my audience (based in USA) that 3 of the 4 biggest promotions of the world are in the US and that UFC is the biggest MMA promotion out of all of them. The idea is for the audience to learn the sporting organization's name and remember it. In my vizualization, i will put the logo in stead of the name in the centre of the bubbles.

### How has the viewership changed throughout the years? 📈

Here, I have highlighted the average number of UFC PPV buys every year from 2004 to 2016 in a line chart. This will help the audience understand if the sport has been growing consistently or not. Any plateaus or dips can be easily visualized in a line chart and it will be really powerfiul to see a trend line throughout the years. I also have a caption box for the year UFC touched highest avergage PPV buys and the fight that made that year so special.

### What styles do the best fighters use? 🥊

Since the sport is "Mixed" Martial Arts, it would be great to see the breakdown of how different martial arts fare against each other. It is observed that wrestling is the most dominant martial art in the sport with 28 of the UFC champions using that style. BJJ is in second place with significantly less number of champions and so on. A bar graph showcasing the styles with their counts has been employed to visualize this. I have used a dark blue for wrestling and a sublte blue for others.

### Let's talk money 🤑

One of the things that easily grabs people's attention is a monetary figure. I used an extremely simple table with names of 7 highest paid athletes in 2021. The number one athlete has been colored green (the color of money) to draw attention first to their earnings before looking at other names.

## Methodology and Medium 🍿

Since my data is highly fragmented, my first step will be to compile data into excel that I can use for visualization. I plan on using these data files in **Tableau** and reproduce my hand-drawn sketches for the final project. Using tableau with real data will give my audience a very accurate representation of what's happening in the data.

For the presentation, I will be using **Shorthand**. The animation and seamless transition abilities provided by the tool is great for impactful storytelling.
