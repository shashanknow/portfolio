# FBI IC3 Crime Report Data Visualization Critique & Redsign

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ The Original Data
This is an interesting visualization provided by the FBI which gives us information about major crimes reported in the US and how they changed in the last 5 years (2017 - 2021). While it is useful for law enforcement and the media, it also informs general citizens and encourages them to take steps to protect themselves.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Let's Critique the Viz üßê

### What worked well üëçüèΩ
- The chart is very complete because it has all necessary information you want to relay to the audience like Top 5 crimes, their count per year and an informative title. 
- It is quite useful for people to know Top 5 crimes to watch out for and how many people are affected. 
- The data can be considered 100% truthful and reliable as it is provided by the FBI. 
- The graph did a good job of informing the audience of the trend for a particular type of crime through the years. 
- Once learned, the darker color makes you think of recent years and lighter colors make you think of many years ago. The numbers next to the bars are informative as well of the count.

### What did not work so well üëéüèΩ
- The chart is not very perceptible because it is not easy to compare different crime types for a particular year and there is no x-axis. 
- There is no distinction except the size of the bar to draw attention to Phishing. 
- Readers are accustomed to read time left to read, reading it from bottom to top is not very intuitive. 
- The categories are not used properly and can be eliminated by using text inside the bars. The Aesthetics are bad and it looks like black and white chart that is tilted 90 degrees. 
- The audience is not engaged enough because their eyes are darting back and forth between the bars and the legend. Also, there are no links to information about crimes to help them learn more about how to protect themselves.

### What would I do differently üòá
- I would tilt the graph so that bars become vertical and I would also add a y-axis with a Number of crimes label. 
- I would group the crimes by years in the x-axis and color code the crimes. 
- I would put an informative sub-heading and talk a little about crimes that are steadily rising. I would also try to highlight Phishing by using a shade of red.

### Intended Audience 
- General Public
- Law Enforcement
- Media
