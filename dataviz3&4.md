# FBI IC3 Crime Report Data Visualization Critique & Redsign

### 1️⃣ The Original Data
This is an interesting visualization provided by the FBI which gives us information about major crimes reported in the US and how they changed in the last 5 years (2017 - 2021). While it is useful for law enforcement and the media, it also informs general citizens and encourages them to take steps to protect themselves.
