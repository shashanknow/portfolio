## User research 

### Target Audience

My primary target audience are people have a faint idea of what the sport is. My project also speaks to existing fans who would like to know more about the sport. Additionally, my project  tries to persuade people who have a natural aversion to violent sports to look at MMA in a new light. Drawing comparisons with other sports helps people who are agnostic of the sport become aware and maybe even inspired to look for more information.

### Identifying individuals to interview

I tried to identify individuals with different level of exposure to the sport to get a sense of what's missing in the project and what is working well.

- Person A, casual fan who watches popular fight highlights
- Person B, has heard of the sport and a few names
- Person C, has no idea what is Mixed Martial Arts

### The Script

- _Have you heard of MMA? WHat are your views on it?_
- _Who do you think this project appeals to aka intended audience?
- _Were the visualizations easy to follow?_
- _Did you feel any kind of disconnect?_
- _What do you wish was there in the content that would help you understand better?_
- _Are you inpsired to find out more about the sport?_

### The Findings

- People felt they were being informed of the success of the sport but did not exactly **relate** to the content.
- People who have a natural aversion to violence or sports in general are not easily persuaded and none of the visualizations speak out to them.
- The most interesting thing about the sport are the fighters, so maybe more information about the life of a fighter.
- One person specifically said, "I wonder what it's like to be an MMA fighter, how much would I make? how much do I have to train?" which gives me more visualization ideas to incorporate into the project.
- There is slight disconnect in the story because there are some elements which do not fit into others like fighting styles of champions after talking about PPV buys.
- There are a little too many colors, especially when talking about a hardcore subject like martial arts. It takes away the feel of the story.
- The number of fans chart makes it look like MMA is not a big deal compared to other mega sports.

### Changes 

- The biggest change I plan on making is to focus my story on people who are interested in the sport and want to be a part of it in any sense.
- I will reoreder a lot of my visualizations and add a few more that talk about the path to becoming a fighter and what their training looks like. Also, cutting weight is a very arduous and facinating part of a fighters life and I will highlight the crazy weight transformation they go through.
- I have no solid call-to-action so I will be adding a "Road to MMA" timeline chart which informs the audience how many years of training and dedication is required on average.
- The storyboard aesthetics are a little unclean and I will apply a darker and consistent color scheme.
- Get rid of the first visualization comparing MMA to other sports as it diminshes the impact of the following charts.
