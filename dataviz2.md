# Sparklines: Country-wise Debt to GDP Ratio Progression (1995 - 2021)
These sparklines represent the progression of a country's Debt-To-GDP ratio from 1995 to 2021. We can see that certain countries have a steadily increasing debt ratio like Japan. A few countries have a fluctuating line chart signalling a rise and fall in debt, for e.g., Estonia. Lastly, we can observe New Zealand as a country with steadily decreasing debt.

# Radial Tree: YoY Progression of Countries with Highest Debt in 2021
The Radial Tree shows us the position of countries of interest: Japan, Greece and Italy. These countries seem to have consistently large Debt-To-GDP ratio across most years. Although Italy does fall to 4th place in years between 2013 - 2009, all 3 countries fall in the top 6 across the entire timeframe. In 1995, Japan started in 6th position, it rose to number 1 in 1999 and has been the country with the highest debt ratio until 2021. Greece has oscillated between 2nd and 3rd place in the early 2000s but it has never been out of the top 5, finally settling into 2nd position year after year with a brief dip into 5th in 2011.
